           A good rule of thumb when running is to dress 10 to 20ËšF warmer than the outside temperature.<br></br></div>
           <div className="tips-item"><h1>ðŸ‘Ÿ</h1>
           Replace your shoes every 300-500 miles and buy shoes 1/2 size larger than normal, as your feet swell when running. Get some comfy socks, too - it will make all the difference!<br></br></div>
           <div className="tips-item"><h1>ðŸŽ½ðŸ§¦</h1>
           When selecting your running clothes, donâ€™t wear cotton. Consider technical, dryfit clothing. </div>
