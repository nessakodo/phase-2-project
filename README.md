## Learning Goals

[ ] - Build a React single page application from scratch
<br>
[ ] - Apply your knowledge of components, props and state management
<br>
[ ] - Incorporate client-side routing
<br>
[ ] - Use data from an API

## Requirements

### Immediate Requirements


[ ] - Create GitHub repos, add all of your group members as contributors to the project, and create a 1-2 sentence pitch about your project.
<br>
[ ] - Create a list of user stories, this is just a statement about what your app will do.
<br>
[ ] - Create some wireframes for your web page.
<br>

### Secondary Requirements

[ ] - You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app.
<br>
[ ] - Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized.
<br>
[ ] - There should be at least **3 client-side routes** using React Router (Links to an external site.). Be sure to include a **nav bar** or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes.
<br>
[ ] - Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server.
<br> 
[ ] - Use a form to make your post request, specifically a controlled form/component. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.
<br>
[ ] - Add some styling: you're encouraged to write your CSS from scratch, either by using styled components or writing CSS files and using id/className to style your elements.
